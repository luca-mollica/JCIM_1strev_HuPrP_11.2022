"Recognition mechanisms between an anti-prion Nanobody and disordered epitopes of the human prion protein: an integrative molecular dynamics study"

by Luca Mollica (UniMI) and Gabriele Giachin (UniPD).

The repositories contain: 

- the structures used for simulating the PrP-Nanobody complexes for the WT form of human prion protein and for its mutants V210I and E219K, i.e., start_now_WT.pdb, start_now_E219K.pdb and start_now_V210I.pdb. The structure of the WT system has been generated from the deposited crystal structure of the complex (PDB ID: 4N9O), the ones of the mutants have been generated in Pymol mutating single residues;

- a size reduced trajectory corresponding to 3 concatenated 1 microsecond MD simulation replicas for each complex. The size reduction has been performed saving 1 frame every 500 ps in order to save storage space. The original trajectories are available on request. 

All the date contained in this repositories are meant without water and counterions. Due to the size of the original trajectories including water and counterions, complete data will be available upon request to the authors (luca.mollica@unimi.it, gabriele.giachin@unipd.it), as well as other data or scripts associated to the analysis reported in the manuscript.
